Spring Boot 2.7.x based backend to demonstrate some JPA stuff

**Used Tech Stack**
- Java 17 LTS

**To build and run the demo on Port 8080: mvn clean spring-boot:run**

### There are a lot of options how to handel entities and dto´s! This demo does a DTO first approach, because some people are having trouble the managed context of a JPA entity.
### Please do not discuss this with me.

### Also DON´T discuss the entity model, it´s just to demo stuff!
